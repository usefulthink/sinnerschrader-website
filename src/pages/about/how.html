	<Story1
		headline="Good stuff comes from `good` team play."
		copy="*We are serious about routines.* But even more serious about keeping them fluid for different situations and projects. As partners, you play a huge role, whether it be for scrum, agile, lean or the good old Waterfall, in helping us evolve and continuously adapt to your needs. This working method gurantees constant exchange of knowledge and learnings and sets you on a path to independence when needed."

But more importantly, because every one of our disciplines, whether ux, design or technology, know sustainable products stem from a good foundation. And from here opportunities grow."
