	<Case1
		headline="Meeting the `demands` of the youth."
		text1="*Fifteen years ago when Deutsche Bank, together with SinnerSchrader, launched maxblue, it helped pioneer the online trading services in Germany.* It disrupted the trading world, giving investors the opportunity to trade with efficiency for the first time. Over a decade later, we were asked to relaunch history, to meet the needs of today’s investor. Investors who are more technologically savvy, with many different devices and sky-high expectations."
		text2="*Prompted by the explosion of online FinTech services, young and inexperienced investors were rapidly becoming a core segment.* Via eleven interviews, we learnt that they struggled to sift through complex information to find a starting point to their investment adventures. Yet they desired to be self-directed, with full control of their portfolios and risk-taking. We saw this as a big opportunity to build a guiding and informative experience that boosts beginners’ confidence."

	<Story1
		headline="Putting on the user’s lens."
		copy="*The approach to meet our user’s needs was to be the user.* So we put on our users’ lenses, deconstructed their investment journey and then rethought the whole thing. We co-created with customers, clients and a multidisciplinary team, through an iterative service design process of eleven in-depth customer interviews, creative brainstorming and rapid prototyping."

	<Story3
		headline="Making `things` simple."
		copy="*Our solution was to transform the trading service into a self-directed and educational experience.* Core to this was to keep things simple for the user. A new UX concept was designed that quickly guided users to relevant information. A team was set up to fuel a new ‘Investment Trends’ content section with frequent and valuable articles. And expert copywriters were hired to transform complex jargon into easily digestible pieces."

Ease and flexibility was central to the new system to ensure heavy daily usage was simple and effortless."
