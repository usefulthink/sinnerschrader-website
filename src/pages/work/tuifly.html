	<Case1
		headline="Business is no longer as `usual`."
		text1="*Pure airline operators had been heavily slapped with the accelerating consolidation of airline services.* TUIfly was faced with the unavoidable consequences of a rapidly changing industry and needed to do something fast. Being TUIflys long term partner, we were asked to put our heads together to navigate into a more promising future. Together we created a new smart travel booking platform."
		text2="*We recognised that to differentiate and be more competitive, we needed turn a new leaf.* So we set out to reposition and transform TUIfly from a pure airlines operator to a airline platform model for the airline industry. One that was profitably tied to a new business model. A technologically modern platform was built from scratch. Value adding services were designed. Solid partnerships were sought. And communications were reshaped."

Furthermore, we introduced a new UX concept for effortless interactions. We reinvented travel booking for TUIfly and this is  we call a truly transformational product."
